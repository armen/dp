Algorithm 3.1: Basic Broadcast

Implements:
    BestEffortBroadcast, instance beb.

Uses:
    PerfectPointToPointLinks, instance pl.

upon event < beb, Broadcast | m > do
    forall q ∈ Π do
        trigger < pl, Send | q, m >

upon event < pl, Deliver | p , m > do
    trigger < beb, Deliver | p , m >
